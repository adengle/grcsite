# **Cycling Community Coordinator Position**
### Enhancing Community Engagement and Advocacy for Trek Bicycle Retail Locations in the St. Louis Metro Area

## **Executive Summary**

Trek Bicycle has established a strong retail presence in the St. Louis metropolitan area with four locations serving a diverse cycling community. To further solidify Trek’s role as a leader in local cycling advocacy, customer engagement, and community development, this proposal recommends the creation of a full-time **Cycling Community Coordinator** position.

This role will be essential in fostering relationships, organizing events across multiple disciplines, building advocacy partnerships, and driving local brand loyalty.

## **Background and Opportunity**

The St. Louis metro area boasts a vibrant and growing cycling culture supported by numerous trails, advocacy groups, and riders of all ability levels. Grassroots efforts at the O’Fallon, MO location demonstrate the measurable benefits of consistent community engagement. Weekly group rides have cultivated a thriving network of advocates who organically invite friends, increasing shop traffic and strengthening brand affinity.

Currently, community engagement responsibilities fall on store staff whose primary duties center on sales and service. This creates a conflict between operational demands and community-building efforts, limiting the impact and consistency of outreach programs.

## **Position Overview**

The Cycling Community Coordinator will oversee community outreach and engagement efforts for all four Trek Bicycle locations in the St. Louis metro area.

### **Key Responsibilities**

- Develop and promote group rides across road, gravel, and mountain biking disciplines.
- Organize and lead in-shop skills clinics, product demos, and educational workshops.
- Coordinate community events, new model launches, and Trek Travel opportunities.
- Build partnerships with regional advocacy organizations such as:
  - Trailnet  
  - Great Rivers Greenways  
  - GORC  
  - Pedal the Cause  
  - Bike MS 150  
- Expand successful initiatives from the O’Fallon location—such as hosting top-tier customers at the annual Trek 100 in Waterloo—to all stores.
- Manage social media and online platforms to promote events and resources.
- Gather community feedback to refine engagement strategies.

## **Anticipated Benefits**

### **Competitive Advantage**

The St. Louis metro area includes over 50 long-established cycling shops. While many host group rides and events, none employ a dedicated, full-time community coordinator. Trek’s St. Louis locations already rank among the highest-rated shops in the region (4.8–4.9 stars). Creating this role would position Trek as the only retailer with a dedicated leader focused solely on community engagement.

### **Event Participation & Community Impact**

The region hosts dozens of cycling events annually, including the Tour of St. Louis and Pedal the Cause. Major races often reach field limits of 75–100 riders per category. A dedicated coordinator would expand Trek’s presence, increase participation, and strengthen community ties.

### **Stronger Community Brand**

Some local cyclists perceive Trek stores as “corporate” or disconnected from the community. A dedicated coordinator would demonstrate Trek’s investment in local riders while leveraging the global strength of the Trek brand.

### **Increased Store Traffic**

Regular events and consistent outreach bring new and returning customers into stores. Dedicated management of social and traditional media will further amplify engagement.

### **Enhanced Trek Loyalty**

Industry research from the National Bicycle Dealers Association (NBDA) shows that shops with regular community outreach and event programming see:

- Up to **20% increase** in repeat customer visits  
- More positive online reviews  
- Stronger customer advocacy  

### **Revenue Growth**

NBDA data indicates that shops actively hosting community events and fostering advocacy partnerships typically realize:

- **10–20% higher sales growth**
- **$100,000–$250,000** average annual revenue increases
- Up to **15% uplift** in accessory and service sales within the first year of implementing a dedicated community coordination role

## **Implementation Plan**

1. Develop a comprehensive job description with qualifications and performance metrics.
2. Recruit candidates with backgrounds in cycling, event management, and community outreach.
3. Onboard and train the selected candidate on Trek’s products, values, and store operations.
4. Introduce the Coordinator to community partners and schedule initial events.
5. Evaluate program effectiveness using engagement metrics, attendance, and sales impact.

## **Budget Considerations**

A full-time Cycling Community Coordinator is necessary to support all four Trek Bicycle retail locations.

**Proposed salary range:**  
**$45,000–$55,000 annually** (plus benefits)

This aligns with Midwest market data for community engagement roles in cycling and outdoor recreation industries.

## **Program Budget**

Estimated annual ranges for serving four retail locations:

| Category | Estimated Annual Cost |
|---------|------------------------|
| Event Planning & Supplies | $6,000–$10,000 |
| Marketing & Promotions | $3,000–$6,000 |
| Community Sponsorships & Partnerships | $2,000–$4,000 |
| Travel & Transportation | $1,500–$3,000 |
| Training & Professional Development | $1,000–$2,000 |

A detailed budget will be finalized following approval of the position.

## **Summary of Proposed Costs**

- **Salary & Benefits:** $45,000–$55,000  
- **Program Budget:** $13,500–$25,000  
- **Total Estimated Annual Cost:** **$58,500–$80,000**

## **Conclusion**

Investing in a full-time Cycling Community Coordinator for the four Trek Bicycle retail locations in St. Louis will position Trek as an integral part of the local cycling scene, drive business growth, and foster lasting relationships with customers and partners.

With proven grassroots success at the O’Fallon location and strong regional advocacy partnerships, this role will unlock new opportunities for engagement, revenue, and community impact.
